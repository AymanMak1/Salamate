             <hr>
             <p>When you register as a user of our Site and Services, we ask for personal information that will be used to activate your account, provide the Services to you, communicate with you about the status of your account, and for other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Your name, company name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information and certain other information about you may be required by us to provide the Services or be disclosed by you during your use of the Services. You will also be asked to create a user name and private password, which will become part of your account information.

                By providing personal information to us and by retaining us to provide you with the Services, you voluntarily consent to the collection, use and disclosure of such personal information as specified in this Privacy Policy. The legal bases for our processing of personal information are primarily that the processing is necessary for providing the Services and that the processing is carried out in our legitimate interests, which are further explained below. Without limiting the foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, use, or disclose your personal information in specific circumstances.

                We take steps designed to ensure that only those employees who need access to your personal information to fulfil their employment duties will have access to it. We may use and disclose your personal or account information for the following purposes: <br> <br>
                    <ul>
                      <li> To provide the Site and Services to you and to other users of the Site and Services;</li>

                      <li> To provide the Site and Services to you and to other users of the Site and Services;</li>
                      <li>  To improve the quality of the Site and Services through polls, surveys and other similar feedback gathering activities conducted by Dribbble and/or third parties;</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>

                For the purposes of billing your account (if you have a paid account) and in order to process payments, Dribbble utilizes third party payment gateways, such as Stripe and Paypal, who will utilize your credit card and other payment information in accordance with their respective privacy policies. Dribbble shall not be liable to you or any other person for any damages that might result from unauthorized use, publication, disclosure or any other misuse of such payment information, including credit card information.

                Dribbble may share your personal information with its registered API application providers, including Chrome tab extensions Panda and Muz.li which deliver relevant design stories and inspiration. We invite you to review their applicable data protection policies.
                out function within all email communications of this nature, or will cease to communicate with you for this purpose if you contact us and tell us not to communicate this information to you. The only kind of these communications that you may not “opt-out” of are those required to communicate announcements related to the Services, including information specific to your Account, planned Services suspensions and outages. We will attempt to minimize this type of communication to you.
